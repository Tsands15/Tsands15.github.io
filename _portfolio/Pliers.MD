## Introduction
Needle nose pliers are a type of pliers that have long, narrow, tapered jaws that come to a point. The jaws of needle nose pliers are typically smooth and straight, but they may also have teeth or serrations to help grip small objects. Needle nose pliers are commonly used for tasks that require precision and dexterity, such as bending and shaping wires or manipulating small parts. They are also useful for reaching into tight spaces that other pliers cannot reach. They may also be used in household tasks, such as removing a splinter or tightening a small screw.
