## Device Description & Applications
The purpose of the microfluidic mixing device is to create a thorough and rapid mixing of multiple fluids on a micro level. Sample mixing is achieved by enhancing the diffusion effect between the different sample flows. The microfluidic device uses a “passive” mixing scheme where contact time and contact area of the fluid are increased through purposefully designed microchannel pathways. Passive micromixers contain no motion in its parts and require no energy input other than the pressure head used to drive the fluid flows at a constant rate along the microfluidic path.

Microfluidic mixing devices are utilized significantly in the biomedical field, specifically with diagnostics and drug developments. One prominent use of microfluidic devices in the biomedical field is the creation of immunoassays. These are used to detect analytes using antibodies. Immunoassays greatly benefit from microfluidic devices by minimizing fluid handling and minimizing washing steps. Additionally samples can be run into multiple microwells within the device, allowing one serum to be tested for multiple antibodies at once. They have seen great usage in the food and chemical industries as well. Microfluidics can also be applied to separating protein and DNA in techniques like capillary electrophoresis and liquid chromatography. Advantages of using microfluidics for these tasks include reduced time and cost and possible adding additional components to the microfluidic device to make the separation that much easier and precise. 

## Design Features & Fabrication
# Main Meandering Channel w/ Intersecting Parallel Channels
This mixture region employs a main meandering channel with perforations in the walls of the main channel. These perforations from connecting channels which are parallel to the main channel. During the mixing process, two discrete fluid samples are fed into the two channel input tubes. As the fluids meet and flow along the main channel. As the fluid proposed mixing chamber contained a main meandering channel with perforated walls that formed connecting channels between parallel segments of the main meandering channel. In the mixing process, two discrete liquid samples were fed into the mixing chamber laminarly. When the liquid wetted one side of the first perforated wall segment, it entered the perforation, but was prevented from exiting by surface tension effects. However, as the bulk of the liquid proceeded on to the next main channel segment, the other side of the perforated wall was wetted. As a result, the liquid/air interface at the exit of the perforation was replaced by a liquid/liquid interface, and hence the liquid flowed freely through the perforation. The same phenomenon was repeated in each of the main channel segments as the liquid flowed progressively through the mixing chamber. As a result, the constantly-changing flow lines within the liquid plug caused a self-folding effect within the plug, yielding a significant improvement in mixing performance.

# Twisted Channel
Micromixers with intersecting channels can be used to split, rearrange and combine component streams to enhance mixing. In the proposed design, all of the channels running parallel to the flow direction had a width of 250 μm, while those intersecting the parallel channel network had a width of 750 μm and were aligned at an angle of 60o. The microchannels were designed so that the two species streams merged into one larger stream and then flowed together along a mixing channel of length 300 μm.
