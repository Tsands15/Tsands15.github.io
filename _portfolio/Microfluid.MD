## Device Description & Applications
The purpose of the microfluidic mixing device is to create a thorough and rapid mixing of multiple fluids on a micro level. Sample mixing is achieved by enhancing the diffusion effect between the different sample flows. The microfluidic device uses a “passive” mixing scheme where contact time and contact area of the fluid are increased through purposefully designed microchannel pathways. Passive micromixers contain no motion in its parts and require no energy input other than the pressure head used to drive the fluid flows at a constant rate along the microfluidic path.
