The sponsor for this project is the Boxing Resource Center, a local nonprofit boxing gym which helps kids and adults enhance their skill and appreciation for the art of boxing.  A critical component of this sport is reaction time and being able to properly read and respond to the opponent's movements, with moves such as a dodge, block or counterattack.  Normally it would be easy to practice these skills when training with a coach or against a sparring partner, but when a boxer is training at home or the gym is crowded this becomes difficult.  The goal is to create a dynamic reaction training device to help the boxer train these skills while practicing on their own.

To address this problem, a light based training tool was developed, specifically a modified reflex bag, a small spherical punching bag mounted to a pole with a spring built in.  This new device will have LEDs embedded into the surface to flash random colored lights at random intervals.  The short burst of light will provide the boxer with an unpredictable visual cue to throw a specific boxing move corresponding to the color.  These moves will be decided upon beforehand, for example red equates to jab and blue equates to hook.  This will enable the boxer to practice reacting and responding to an opponent while they are training alone.  It forces the boxer into a reactive mindset rather than deciding what move to do when normally punching a reflex bag.
