# Introduction and Background
The sponsor for this project is the Boxing Resource Center, a local nonprofit boxing gym which helps kids and adults enhance their skill and appreciation for the art of boxing.  A critical component of this sport is reaction time and being able to properly read and respond to the opponent's movements, with moves such as a dodge, block or counterattack.  Normally it would be easy to practice these skills when training with a coach or against a sparring partner, but when a boxer is training at home or the gym is crowded this becomes difficult.  The goal is to create a dynamic reaction training device to help the boxer train these skills while practicing on their own.

To address this problem we are developing a light based training tool, specifically a modified reflex bag, a small spherical punching bag mounted to a pole with a built in spring.  This new device will have LEDs embedded into the surface to flash random colored lights at random intervals.  The short burst of light will provide the boxer with an unpredictable visual cue to throw a specific boxing move corresponding to the color.  These moves will be decided upon beforehand, for example red equates to jab and blue equates to hook.  This will enable the boxer to practice reacting and responding to an opponent while they are training alone.  It forces the boxer into a reactive mindset rather than deciding what move to do when normally punching a reflex bag.

Additionally the reflex bag shall have an accelerometer inserted underneath the surface.  This sensor will be able to sense when the bag is punched by detecting a sharp impulse in movement.  This data can be used to calculate the boxerâ€™s reaction time or speed of their punches, providing instant feedback they can use in their training.  Additional training modes and games can be implemented utilizing the impact detection or overall movement of the bag. 
	
This new reflex bag can be seen on the title page. It consists of a solid 3D printed core covered in two layers of padding.  This padding has spaces cut out for LED lights and diffuser channels which wrap around the ball in an easy to read pattern.  These lights can randomly flash red, blue or green at randomly determined intervals.  The number of colors available and the average time between the flashes can be adjusted by the boxer to set the desired difficulty level.  The bag is mounted on top of a standard reflex bag pole, which can be fixed to the ground and used.  Two bent washers are able to be firmly inserted into the core so when it is attached to the top using a lock washer and bolt it will be fully constrained to the pole and unable to slide off or rotate.
