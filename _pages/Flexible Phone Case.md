  # Introduction
  
The global mobile phone accessories market reached a value of US $80.44 billion in 2021. The market is projected to reach a value of US $116.39 billion by 2027, exhibiting a CAGR of 6.10% during 2022-20271. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted the balance between supply and demand in the smartphone market with the CAGR value being 0.4% percent more pre-COVID. Thus, the pandemic had a negative impact on the market. However, rugged phone cases that can help protect the handset from knocks and bumps and also prevent a cracked screen are in higher demand presently. Phone cases with specific designs have almost become a prominent item in the market due to the individuality sought after by the typical smartphone user, granting the smartphone case market a strong base that will continue to rise for years to come, barring another pandemic. 


# Design

* **First Design Factor: Phone Thickness.** The first important design factor that had to be considered as the phone thickness. The phone thickness determines how much protection the phone has when trying to prevent outside forces from damaging or affecting the phone. This is essentially the most important part of the phone case as this is the main reason why people would put a phone case on their phones, to protect it from falls or other impacting forces. Therefore, I had to ensure the phone case was thick enough to protect against those damaging forces while also making sure the phone case wasnâ€™t too bulky to fit in your pocket or fit comfortably in my hand. That is how I concluded to design the phone case with a thickness of 2 mm as I believe that is the perfect medium between protection and sleekness.

* **Second Design Factor: Button Location.**  The second important design factor I had to consider was how to make the buttons on either side of the phone accessible. This is necessary as being able to easily turn off your phone, turn the volume up or down, or put your phone on silent are key components of a phone that cannot be restricted if you want the full functionality of the phone. I made the power button on the right side of the phone case and the volume and mute rocker on the left side of the phone accessible by putting squares approximately where those buttons are. The squares are large enough to where fingers can easily touch the buttons with no interference while utilizing the wall thickness to protect the buttons from outside damaging sources. Each of the buttons, power, volume, and mute rocker have individualized squares so you know where exactly the button is without having to look directly at the phone case, allowing for button pressing within the pocket if that action is required for certain situations.  

* **Third Design Factor: Protection vs Usability.** The third important design factor I had to consider is protecting the phone screen while simultaneously not restricting the usable phone area. This is necessary as the phone screen is the most fragile part of the phone, so protecting this area of the phone is a key component of a functional phone case as no one wants to use a cracked phone. This was accomplished by making a phone case bump on the front face of the phone case. The functionality of this bump is creating a raised surface along the edge of the front face of the phone case. whenever the phone case falls front on its face, the impact is felt by the bump which is then translated into the rest of the phone case rather than the phone screen which can lead to cracks or scratches on the phone screen. The bump also ensures the phone fits securely into the phone case so it will never come out on its own. The phone bump is still small enough to where the entire touchable area of the phone screen is still accessible, so you are not sacrificing any functionality of the phone for protection, which is the optimal goal of phone cases.

* **Fourth Design Factor: Personliazed Design Element.** The design element I decided to choose for my phone case is my self-proclaimed logo, an S in a block design since my last name is Sands. I choose this design as the logo is personal to me and makes the case easily identifiable among the entire class. This design would make my phone case more competitive as it makes the already robust phone case have a nice aesthetic to it, leading to a phone case that excels in both protection quality and design which is a very appealing combination to phone case customers. 


# Parametric Modeling

Parametric modeling was an essential part of creating this phone case as it expedited many measurements and calculations that I otherwise would have spent unnecessary time doing.
The three parametric sets within my phone design were the phone case wall thickness, phone
case wall length, and phone case wall width. Having these 3 as parametric parameters allows the
size of the phone case to be changed with ease and allows for flexibility when designing the
phone case. This way I could easily change the phone case to fit larger or smaller phones with
the simple click of two buttons and a number change instead of having to redraw the entire
sketch of the phone. Additionally, other features based on the set parametric modeling are
flexible as well and will change simultaneously with the thickness, width, and length if needed,
allowing for extensive changes with very little effort
